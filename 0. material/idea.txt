create an built-in cyber-chef into IDA

 -----------
| Feature 1 |
 -----------
    - user can open the tool
    - choose what algorithm he want
    - type the byte_name rather than copy and paste values
    Boom...ðŸ’¥ he will have the decryption text

 -----------
| Feature 2 |
 -----------
    user can insert his own decryption file into the program
        - for example if the function take two parameter func(key, ct)
            - it will appear like two text input (number of parameter)
            - hidden text in each input panel with the same variable name passed to parameter
             ---------     ---------
            |  key    |   |   ct    |
             ---------     ---------
                       ----------------------
                      |      result          | (depend on how many values are returned from that func)
                       ----------------------

    you can save that file for feature work

 -----------
| Feature 3 |
 -----------
        for example if the alogrithm is AES and you find the 
            key, IV
        you can set these values and set it as Block_1
        and you can loop through all values encrypted using these values
                            OR
        right click on the encrypted value and choose option decrypt with Block_1
        and it will edit the ida value to the decrypted the value 
        + add comment that was decrypted by Block_1
 
 -----------
| Feature 4 |
 -----------
    imagine that IDA doesn't list some bytes
        - you can select those bytes 
        - name them as var1 for example
        - do your operation

        - these data can be overwritten
            - if a simple vm obfuscation being xored with a specific value for example
